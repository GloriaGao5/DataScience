## Kaggle Projects
#### Project 1: Spooky Author Classification
    
+ Project summary: In this project(https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification), we are going to answer questions below  
    + predict the author of excerpts from horror stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and HP Lovecraft.
    + Feature extraction, feature engineering, text mining
    + Deep Learning 

+ Data source:  
    + https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification/data   
        + Each dataset is organized as three tables: train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv   


#### Project 2: NYC Green Taxi Trip Data Challenge
    
+ Project summary: For the challenge, we will use data collected by the New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about "Green" Taxis. Green Taxis (as opposed to yellow ones) are taxis that are not allowed to pick up passengers inside of the densely populated areas of Manhattan. We will use the data from September 2015. We are using NYC Taxi and Limousine trip record data: (http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml).

  + Question 1
    + Programmatically download and load into your favorite analytical tool the trip data for September 2015.
    + Report how many rows and columns of data you have loaded.
  + Question 2
    + Plot a histogram of the number of the trip distance ("Trip Distance").
    + Report any structure you find and any hypotheses you have about that structure.
  + Question 3
    + Report mean and median trip distance grouped by hour of day.
    + We'd like to get a rough sense of identifying trips that originate or terminate at one of the NYC area airports. Can you             provide a count of how many transactions fit this criteria, the average fair, and any other interesting characteristics of these trips.
  + Question 4
    + Build a derived variable for tip as a percentage of the total fare.
    + Build a predictive model for tip as a percentage of the total fare. Use as much of the data as you like (or all of it). We will validate a sample.
